## Project Overview

FoodieFeedback leverages machine learning to analyze and classify customer feedback about food. By understanding customer sentiments, restaurants can make informed decisions to enhance their offerings and overall customer satisfaction.

## Features

- Analyze customer feedback on food.
- Classify feedback as positive or negative.
- Machine learning models used: Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes.
- Achieved 80% accuracy with Logistic Regression.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Flask (for future web app feature)

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of customer feedback on various food items. The data is already provided in the repository.

## Model Performance

- **Logistic Regression**: Achieved an accuracy of 80%.
- **Naive Bayes**: Performance details are available in the evaluation script.

## Future Work

The next feature to be added to FoodieFeedback is a Flask web application to provide an interactive interface for users to submit feedback and see real-time analysis results.
